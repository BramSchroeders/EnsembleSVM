## Introduction

EnsembleSVM is a library providing an API to implement ensemble
learning use Support Vector Machine (SVM) base models. The package
contains some executable tools which behave similar to standard
SVM learning algorithms.

The package is self-contained in the sense that it contains most
necessary tools to build a pipeline for binary classification. Most
notable features include bootstrap sampling, cross-validation and
ensemble training/prediction.

The EnsembleSVM webpage contains all sorts of useful information at:

EnsembleSVM uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle large data
sets by training base models on (small) subsamples and aggregating
these base models into a strong ensemble.
